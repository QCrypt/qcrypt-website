# DevFest Theme Hugo

The theme is located in the `/themes/devfest-theme-hugo/` subdirectory. It originated as an [independent theme](https://github.com/GDGToulouse/devfest-theme-hugo), as a separate git submodule, but since 2023, it's permanently included in the git repository.

> [!NOTE]
> The original multi-lingual support has been dropped, but reminders of it are still lingering around.

## Getting ready to edit the theme

> [!WARNING]
> This has only been tested on macOS so far, so sharing your experience with other platforms here is very appreciated!

Some version of `npm` might already be installed on your system, check which one with `$ npm --version`. If that works, you can run in the main `\qcrypt-website` folder

```bash
$ npm clean-install
```

to install the dependencies as specified in [package.json](/package.json). This will create a `node_modules` subfolder which should not be included in the git repositry (that's why it's excluded in the [.gitignore](/.gitignore)).

This has installed the PostCSS features, so now you should be able to run

```bash
$ hugo build
```

which builds the whole site to the `/public` subfolder, which is also excluded from the git repository. You can always delete this whole folder (`$ rm -rf qcrypt-website/public`) and rebuild it with the command above.

### Install Node.js

If you don't have `npm` already, install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download), in particular install `v22.12.0 (LTS)` for `macOS/linux/windows` using `nvm` with `npm`. `nvm` is a cross-platform Node.js version manager.

Make sure you are using the latest `npm` version by

```bash
$ nvm use --lts
Now using node v22.12.0 (npm v10.9.0)
```

## A Guided Walk through the ingredients

Hugo is a static website generator. This means that it takes content files encoded in `.md` files and produces _static HTML_ files that can be easily served by a webserver. In our case, [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) takes care of that. When you run the `$ hugo build` command, this building process is executed and the resulting files are stored in the `/public` directory.

The HTML content mainly comes from the mark-down content files in [/content](/content). These files are organized in subfolders, starting with the year, and then further subdivisions.

The more data-type content (such as the list of accepted papers and posters, as well as the schedule) is provided from YAML and JSON files in [/data](/data). The data files for the list of accepted papers and posters can be exported (by the PC chair) from the [HotCRP](https://hotcrp.com/) submission handling system. These files should then be [sanitized](https://github.com/QCrypt/qcrypt-website/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#accepted-papers-and-posters-are-known) before adding them to the repository. The schedule needs to be created manually.

[Hugo templates](https://gohugo.io/templates/introduction/) make the content appear in a structured way. The templates are all in [/themes/devfest-theme-hugo/assets/layouts](/themes/devfest-theme-hugo/layouts). It takes a while to figure out which template is used to create particular content.

-   The basis is [baseof.html](/themes/devfest-theme-hugo/layouts/_default/baseof.html). It's quite instructive to try to understand its structure. It uses various others [partial templates](/themes/devfest-theme-hugo/layouts/partials), it defines _blocks_ like "header", "banner", "main" that contain some content, but which might be overwritten by other templates later on.
-   An interesting partical template is [head.html](/themes/devfest-theme-hugo/layouts/partial/head.html) which defined the `<head>` section of the site, including various parameters, icons, RSS, CSS etc.
-   [css.html](/themes/devfest-theme-hugo/layouts/partials/css.html) is using [Hugo Pipes](https://gohugo.io/hugo-pipes/introduction/) to create a CSS file `css/style-YEAR.css` from the SASS template `style/theme-YEAR.scss` (e.g. [theme-2024.scss](/themes/devfest-theme-hugo/assets/style/theme-2024.scss)). When using `hugo server` the file is immediately served and used, when running `hugo build`, the style file is stored in `\css\style-YEAR.css` and served from there.
-   An interesting partial template is [header.html](/themes/devfest-theme-hugo/layouts/partial/header.html), as it defines the menu structure, and retrieves the logo of the current year for the menu bar.
-   [footer.html](/themes/devfest-theme-hugo/layouts/partials/footer.html) displays the footer.
-   [js.html](/themes/devfest-theme-hugo/layouts/partials/js.html) is the partial template inserted at the end of the [header.html](/themes/devfest-theme-hugo/layouts/partial/header.html). It uses the [Hugo JS functions](https://gohugo.io/functions/js/) to create one `main.js` file which is then included as `<script>`
-   `icon.html` is an identical [shortcode](/themes/devfest-theme-hugo/layouts/shortcodes/icon.html) and [partial template](/themes/devfest-theme-hugo/layouts/partials/icon.html) to display icons from ['assets/icons'](/themes/devfest-theme-hugo/assets/icons). If you need another icon, try adding it to this folder!

Besides the HTML, the site needs CSS and JavaScript to run and be displayed properly. These assets are provided in:

-   `assets/icons/` - Icon assets
-   `assets/style/` - SCSS source files
-   `assets/script/` - JavaScript source files

### SASS

SASS (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) is a preprocessor scripting language that is compiled into CSS. It provides features like variables, nested rules, mixins, and functions, making CSS maintenance more efficient. In our theme, SASS files are processed through Hugo Pipes, which compiles them into regular CSS files during the build process. The main entry point is `theme-YEAR.scss`, which imports various partial SCSS files to create a modular and maintainable stylesheet structure.
For example, the [theme-2024.scss](/themes/devfest-theme-hugo/assets/style/theme-2024.scss) file serves as the main stylesheet for the 2024 website, importing various partial SCSS files to build the complete CSS. This modular approach helps in organizing styles into manageable and reusable components, making the codebase easier to maintain and extend. The file also defines a root-level custom property for the primary color, ensuring consistent use of the color throughout the website.

This primary color is the main (and so far only) difference between the styles of the different years, but more variables of [\_root.scss](/themes/devfest-theme-hugo/assets/style/_root.scss) could be included in the distinction in the future.

When running the local hugo server, the `enableSourceMap` and `sourceMapContents` options are [turned on](/themes/devfest-theme-hugo/layouts/partials/css.html) (and no PostCSS and minification happen), so that the developer console in the browser should refer to the `.scss` files that were used.

The [sass-mq](/themes/devfest-theme-hugo/assets/style/sass-mq/) mixin is directly included as sub-directory in the assets. It helps styling the page for smaller screens like mobile phones. It is used frequently througout the SASS code. See [its documentation](https://github.com/sass-mq/sass-mq). Including the line

```sass
  $show-breakpoints: $show-breakpoints
```

in [\_variables.scss](/themes/devfest-theme-hugo/assets/style/_variables.scss) will display the currently active breakpoints in the top right corner.

Check [these tips](#debugging-sass) for debugging the SASS part.

## Theme Structure

### Header

The top navigation bar is build with

-   Site title
-   Site parameter `logos.header` for the logo, specified per year in [hugo.toml](../../hugo.toml)
-   Menu `main`

### Footer

The footer is build with

-   Site title
-   Site params `email`, `subscriptionUrl`, `logos.footer`, `copyright`
-   data from `data/footer.yml`

```yml
share:
    - name: facebook
      url: https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=
    - name: twitter
      url: https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=

follow:
    - name: twitter
      url: https://twitter.com/Qcryptc
    - name: youtube
      url: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClpn9CxuZPHw3nzhdv0m3Hw

content:
    - title: footer_about
      links:
          - nameKey: footer_charter
            name: QCrypt Charter
            url: /charter/
            newTab: false
          - nameKey: footer_history
            name: QCrypt History
            url: /history/
            newTab: false
          - nameKey: footer_coc
            name: QCrypt Code of Conduct
            url: /code-of-conduct/
            newTab: false
```

There are also quite some more options in the original tempalate that we are currently not using.

The `url` in the links of `footer_about` is prepended with the `.Params.currentYear`, so that the footer always point to these documents of the current year.

### Home

The Home page is build with markdown and calling some shortcodes like `jumbo`, `button-link`, `home-info` etc..

#### Jumbo bloc

```hugo
{{% jumbo img="/images/2024/background-2024.jpg" imgLabel="QCrypt 2024 background" logo="/images/2024/QCrypt_2024_logo_final.png" %}}

The `session` field refers to the `.md` content file in `/YEAR/sessions/`.
The `time` field is the start time of the day.

> [!NOTE]
> When displaying a single session like [this one](https://qcrypt.net/2023/sessions/tutorial_yuen/), the start and end time are inferred from the schedule. In particular, the **end time** is the start time of the next event. Therefore, it's wise to include a `__endofday` event in the schedule of every day.

### Charter, History, Code of Conduct, other pages

just classic markdown files.

### Blog (not used)

A blog should have these params:

```yaml
title: Title
brief: Short brief
image: /images/blog/photo.jpeg
date: 2019-01-20
draft: false
```

And of course, the body is the blog post.

## Debugging and Developing

Editing the theme can be tricky at times.

### Which template?

Hugo's [template lookup order](https://gohugo.io/templates/lookup-order/) is not straightforward, so often it's not fully clear which template is actually used to display the current page. Therefore, when the local `hugo server` is run, some additional debug information is displayed on the page, often clarifying which template is used, and some additional information about the context.

This information is not displayed in a production environment, so don't worry about it.

```hugo
{{ if hugo.IsProduction | not }}
  <div style="background: #f0f0f0; padding: 10px; margin: 10px; font-family: monospace; font-size: 12px;">
    <details>
      <summary>Debug Info from baseof.html </summary>
      <pre>
  Page Kind: {{ .Kind }}
  RelPermalink: {{ .RelPermalink }}
  Anchorized RelPermalink: {{ anchorize .RelPermalink }}
  Section: {{ .Section }}
  Section Type: {{ printf "%T" .Section }}
  Section Type: {{ len .Section }}
  Section empty? {{ eq .Section "" }}
  Type: {{ .Type }}
  Layout: {{ .Layout }}
  Current Section: {{ .CurrentSection }}
  Parent Section: {{ .CurrentSection.Parent }}
  Params.currentYear: {{ .Site.Params.currentYear }}
  Current Year: {{ $currentYear }}
      </pre>
    </details>
  </div>
{{ end }}
```

### Debugging Hugo Pipes

[Hugo Pipes](https://gohugo.io/hugo-pipes/introduction/) is Hugo's asset processing for creating CSS from SASS, to run PostCSS, minify resources etc.

For debugging, various `warnf` messages are ready to be un-commented in the crucial [css.html](/themes/devfest-theme-hugo/layouts/partials/css.html), [js.html](/themes/devfest-theme-hugo/layouts/partials/js.html) and [icon.html](/themes/devfest-theme-hugo/layouts/shortcodes/icon.html) files.

### Debugging SASS

For testing and debugging purposes, you can also build the `css` outside of Hugo. Make sure you have [Dart Sass](https://gohugo.io/hugo-pipes/transpile-sass-to-css/) installed. The run the following in the `qcrypt-website` main folder

```bash
$ sass --watch path-to-file-to-be-debug:debug.css
```

This command should generate two files `debug.css` and `debug.css.map` in main folder, in which you can see more details that may help you debug your sass file. It should be noted that only these two files were added into `.gitignore`, so if you run the upper command with a different debug filename, please remember to delete the debug files before you make a commit.

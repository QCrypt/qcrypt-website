## VISA

Sanya implements a visa-free policy for inbound tourists from 59 countries. It is estimated that most participants will meet the policy. Please read carefully and check if you meet the visa-free policy following the link:

-   [Hainan 59 Country Visa-Free Entry Policy Guide](https://en.hainan.gov.cn/englishgov/Application/202112/d29eec2f775d4b2294e2061a78c28d70.shtml)

Below, we highlight several important information for the visa-free policy entry:

-   Travelers from the 68 visa free entry eligible countries may travel from or through Hong Kong or any other places outside Mainland China with a direct flight to Hainan.
-   The maximum length of stay for visa free travelers in Hainan is 30 days.

If you are not sure whether you meet the conditions for visa-free entry to Hainan Island, please consult the Chinese Embassy in your country. To be on the safe side, we suggest that it is best to apply for a visa.

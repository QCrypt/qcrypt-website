## Biography

Yang Li received his PhD from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) in 2016, where he currently serves as an associate researcher. His general research interests lie within quantum key distribution and quantum cryptography, with particular emphasis on experimental implementations of free-space and satellite-based QKD systems.

## Abstract

Quantum key distribution (QKD) enables secure communication guaranteed by the fundamental laws of physics. While the Micius satellite has verified the feasibility of satellite-based QKD, deploying large-scale quantum constellations remains a challenge, requiring miniaturized satellites, portable ground stations, and real-time key exchange. To this end, I will present the development and launch of a quantum microsatellite and the subsequent demonstration of real-time satellite-ground QKD with multiple small-aperture, portable ground stations. During a single satellite pass, we generated a secure key of up to 1.07 million bits. Also, a secret key, enabling one-time pad encryption of images, is created between China and South Africa at locations separated by over 12,900â€‰kilometers on Earth. This achievement represents a critical step toward a practical global quantum network. I will also present our ongoing progress in demonstrating daylight QKD, as well as the developments of a low-Earth-orbit satellite constellation prototype and a high-Earth-orbit quantum satellite.

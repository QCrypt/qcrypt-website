## Abstract

Traditional information technology relies on optical fibers as its backbone to connect base stations for extensive and flexible information coverage, thus being constrained by the coverage range of optical fibers. In recent years, new productive forces such as satellite internet and the low-altitude economy have gained growing attention. It is anticipated that a fiber-independent optical quantum information network built on mobile platforms can be developed to enable flexible quantum communication and other applications. The key to these applications is the development of miniaturized optoelectronic integrated devices with low noise, fast modulation, and high efficiency, so as to meet the urgent demands of emerging information technologies like high-security communication in mobile platform-based optical quantum information networks and modern applications such as the low-altitude economy.

To this end, we have developed optoelectronic chip information devices including high-efficiency, lightweight quantum light sources and high-precision, lightweight tracking and aiming systems. Furthermore, we have completed a series of experiments on entangled photon distribution, entangled photon distribution via optical relays, and quantum key distribution, using UAVs and other mobile platforms. These efforts have laid the groundwork for constructing a low-altitude optical information network that integrates classical and quantum technologies, driving the advancement of next-generation quantum communication technology and the low-altitude economy.

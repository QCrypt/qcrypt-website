## Biography

Gl√°ucia Murta is an Assistant Professor at the Atominstitut of TU Wien, where I lead the research group on Quantum Foundations and Cryptography. Our work explores fundamental aspects of quantum correlations and their applications to quantum cryptography. In particular, we investigate how steering and Bell nonlocality can be harnessed to develop protocols that are inherently resilient to hacking and device imperfections. We also study how multipartite entanglement and high-dimensional systems can overcome the limitations of bipartite qubit-based protocols, enabling more efficient cryptographic schemes and new quantum functionalities.

## Abstract

Secure communication is a core task in cryptography which is focused on protecting the content of a message against eavesdroppers. In certain scenarios, however, the identities of the communicating parties are themselves sensitive and must remain concealed. This calls for anonymous communication protocols that ensure not only message secrecy but also the privacy of participants' identities. In this talk, I will present recent advances showing how quantum systems can offer advantages for anonymous communication in network settings. I will introduce a security framework that encompasses the secrecy of a shared key and the anonymity of the communicating users and show how the correlations of multipartite Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states enable protocols that outperform those based on bipartite entanglement. I will also highlight a recent experimental realization that demonstrates that these advantages are already accessible with current technology. Finally, I will outline open questions and possible directions for future research in this emerging area.

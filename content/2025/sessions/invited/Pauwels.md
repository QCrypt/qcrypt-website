## Biography

Jef Pauwels is a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Geneva and Constructor University. He obtained his PhD in 2023 at the Université libre de Bruxelles. His research focuses on quantum correlations, entangled measurements, and (semi-)device-independent protocols.

## Abstract

Transmission loss remains a major obstacle for long-distance demonstrations of nonlocality and device-independent applications. In this talk, I will discuss routed Bell experiments, in which a particle sent to one party in a Bell experiment can be measured either near or far from the source, as a promising approach to overcoming this challenge. I will explain how to characterize correlations in routed setups, how to compute device-independent key rates, and present a routed Bell inequality that can be violated by qubit entanglement with arbitrary loss.

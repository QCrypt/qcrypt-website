## Biography

Kirill Fedorov received his PhD from the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (Germany) in 2013 and he is currently a principal investigator at Walther-Meissner-Institut and a lecturer (Privatdozent) at Technical University of Munich. His general research interests lie within experiments with superconducting quantum circuits and propagating quantum microwaves. In particular, he focuses on realization of quantum networks in the microwave regime with a particular emphasis on quantum sensing and quantum key distribution protocols.

## Abstract

Microwave quantum communication is set to play an important role in future quantum networks because of its natural frequency compatibility with superconducting quantum processors and modern near-distance communication standards. To this end, I present the experimental realization of a continuous-variable quantum key distribution (QKD) protocol based on propagating displaced squeezed microwave states, which can be generated and detected using superconducting parametric devices. I demonstrate the unconditional security in our experimental QKD setting with a potential for secure microwave communication over distances up to 1000 m in the cryogenic environment. Furthermore, I present our ongoing efforts towards bringing quantum secure microwave communication to high temperatures by implementing quantum teleportation of coherent microwaves over thermal channels with fidelities exceeding the asymptotic no-cloning threshold. Finally, I discuss the feasibility and possible use cases of room temperature, open-air microwave quantum communication.

## Bio

Yang Liu works on experimental quantum communication in Jinan Institute of Quantum Technology (JIQT). He demonstrate measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (MDI-QKD), eliminating the most critical security vulnerability in practical QKD systems. The work was selected asHighlights of the Year by the American Physical Society in 2013. He develops the key technologies of wavelength calibration and phase compensation for independent light sources, demonstrate the feasibility of twin-field (TF) QKD. He develops the method to control the critical noise in TF-QKD systems, achieving a quantum key distribution demonstration over 1,002 kilometers. Furthermore, the work demonstrated that the phase-sensitive TF-QKD can be used to detect vibrations in fiber optic links. He experimentally developed high-efficiency entanglement sources to achieve loophole-free Bell inequality violation, demonstrate device-independent (DI) quantum random number generation (QRNG) in experiment. The randomness beacon (https://randomnessbeacon.com/) based on this work may provide truly physics-based, high-security random number services.

## Abstract

The key rate of traditional QKD protocols scales linearly with the channel transmittance. TF-QKD improves this relation to the square root the channel transmittance, within the reach of current technology. In my tutorial talk, "Twin-field quantum key distribution experiments", I will introduce the fundamentals of twin-field quantum key distribution (TF-QKD) experiments. This would cover the basic implementation of the protocol, the key components of the experimental setup and the performance characteristics of practical TF-QKD systems. The talk will also address critical aspects of building a TF-QKD system, including the laser frequency locking techniques and phase fluctuation compensation methods. The talk will discuss the strategies for enhancing system performance, including the the noise and attenuation analysis, and the methods to optimize system performance. The talk will explore the related twin-field QKD protocols and the implementations.

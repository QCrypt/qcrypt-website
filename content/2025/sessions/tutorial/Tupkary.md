## Biography

Devashish Tupkary received his undergraduate degree in Physics from the Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, in 2020. He completed his Master’s in Physics at the Institute for Quantum Computing, University of Waterloo, in 2022, where he is currently pursuing a PhD. His research focuses on the security analysis of practical quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols. He has a broad interest in all areas of cryptography.

## Abstract

Protocol security of quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols refers to the derivation of a rigorous mathematical statement asserting the security the protocol, starting from a precise mathematical model of the protocol. In this tutorial, we will introduce key concepts required to construct such proofs. We will highlight common gaps in the existing literature and discuss how they can be addressed. We will provide a brief overview of the different security proof techniques available, outlining how they work and comparing their strengths and limitations.

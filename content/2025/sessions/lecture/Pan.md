Jian-Wei Pan, born on 11 March 1970, received his Bachelor (1992) and Master (1995) in Physics from the University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, and his PhD (1999) from the University of Vienna. He is currently a Professor of Physics at the University of Science and Technology of China, an Academician of Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), a Fellow of the World Academy of Sciences (TWAS) and a foreign member of the Royal Society (London). He serves as the Director of the CAS Center for Excellence in Quantum Information and Quantum Physics. 

Prof. Jian-Wei Panâ€™s research fields focus on quantum foundations, quantum optics and quantum information. Pan pioneers in multi-particle interferometry and quantum experiments in space. He closed major loopholes for secure quantum communication associated with imperfect devices, making it a viable technology under realistic conditions. His group developed the quantum satellite Micius, demonstrated the first intercontinental quantum communication. These pioneering efforts bring global-scale secure quantum communication from a purely theoretical concept to reality. His group demonstrated quantum computational advantage, validating the feasibility of quantum computing systems to outperform classical machines in solving specific problems. He has also conducted a series of studies in quantum simulation with ultracold gas, including research on synthetic gauge potentials, atom-atom entanglement, ultracold molecular chemistry, and quantum simulation of the Fermi-Hubbard model.
